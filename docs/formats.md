# Intermediate Formats

This document specifies the file formats used between the pipeline stages. These formats are plain text and stable enough to support external tooling or CLI rewrites.

## Data/<vehicle>.txt (stage 1 output)

Text file with simple key:value pairs and repeated projectile blocks. Example header lines:

- WeaponPath:<relative/path/to/weapon.blkx>
- RocketPath:<relative/path/to/rocket.blkx> (optional)
- ZoomIn:<float>
- ZoomOut:<float>
- HasLaser (flag line without a value; present if the vehicle has a laser)

Then one or more projectile entries, each starting with Name:<id>. Fields are one per line; unknown or unused fields may be omitted. Example fields include:

- Name:<string> — projectile identifier used for filenames and sight labels
- Type:<string> — projectile type (e.g., he_frag_i, ap_t, apds_autocannon, apds_fs_long_tank, atgm_tandem_tank, atgm_vt_fuze_tank)
- BulletMass:<float> — projectile mass in kg
- BallisticCaliber:<float> — ballistic caliber in meters (e.g., 0.03 for 30 mm)
- Speed:<float> — muzzle velocity in m/s
- Cx:<float|list> — drag coefficient. If a list is found in datamine, stage 1 writes an averaged value.
- ExplosiveMass:<float> — mass of explosive filler in kg (HE, HEI, etc.)
- ExplosiveType:<string> — explosive type key (e.g., a_ix_2, ocfol)
- demarrePenetrationK:<float> — DeMarre base coefficient
- demarreSpeedPow:<float>
- demarreMassPow:<float>
- demarreCaliberPow:<float>
- DamageMass:<float> — for composite rounds
- DamageCaliber:<float>
- ArmorPower:<float> — for rockets/ATGMs or APDS-FS when a single representative value is used

APDS-FS armor power arrays (if present in the source) are flattened into scalar fields named for range breakpoints, e.g.:

- APDS0, APDS100, APDS200, ..., APDS10000 — armor power values (mm) indexed by distance in meters

Blocks are separated by a blank line. Example (truncated, from examples/Data/ussr_bmp_2m.txt):

Name:30mm_UOF8
Type:he_frag_i
BulletMass:0.389
BallisticCaliber:0.03
Speed:960.0
Cx:0.29841
ExplosiveMass:0.049
ExplosiveType:a_ix_2
demarrePenetrationK:0.15
demarreSpeedPow:1.43
demarreMassPow:0.71
demarreCaliberPow:1.07

Note:
- For exact extraction rules (which keys are read from the datamine, how arrays vs scalars are handled, and all defaults/fallbacks), see docs/datamine-to-data.md.
- APDS-FS armor power series may be omitted in current Stage 1 because only types starting with `apds` trigger series capture. This will be addressed in a future rewrite.

## Ballistic/<vehicle>/<shell>.txt (stage 2 output)

Tabular file with three columns separated by tabs:

distance_m    time_s    penetration_mm

- distance_m: floating-point distance along the line of fire in meters
- time_s: time of flight to that distance in seconds
- penetration_mm: integer or float penetration in mm (0 for HE and non-penetrating munitions)

Rows start at 0 distance and increase monotonically. Example (truncated, from examples/Ballistic/ussr_bmp_2m/UBR6.txt):

0.000	0	65
121.166	0.1	62
246.138	0.3	59
...

## Localization CSVs

Sight rendering uses localized labels loaded from CSV files in Localization/:

- FCS.csv — UI labels for the sights (e.g., Rangefinder, Target lock, ON, Distance, units)
- units_weaponry.csv — human-readable weapon names used when resolving projectile/sight names

These CSVs have a first column key and one column per language (English, French, German, Russian, etc.). The Create(...) methods select language-specific strings based on the app’s UI setting.

## UserSights/<vehicle>/*.blk (stage 3 output)

Generated War Thunder sight scripts. Their contents depend on sight family, language, and options. At a high level, they include drawing sections like:

- drawCircles — reticle rings, central dot, frames
- drawLines — axis lines, preemptive lead lines, distance correction ticks
- drawTexts — labels such as sight name, range scale, time/armor power readouts

Each sight family has its own layout conventions. See docs/sights.md for family-specific notes.
