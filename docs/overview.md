# WT-FCSGenerator — High-level Overview

This project generates user sights for War Thunder ground vehicles by transforming datamined game assets into ready-to-use sight scripts. It follows a simple three-stage pipeline driven by three buttons in the WinForms UI:

1) Convert Datamine → produces intermediate per-vehicle Data files
2) Make Ballistic → produces per-shell ballistic tables
3) Make Sights → renders sight .blk scripts from the ballistics and localization

The pipeline is intentionally file-based, which makes the stages loosely coupled and easy to re-run independently. You can use the provided examples directory to understand inputs/outputs of each stage without running the app.

## Repository layout

- src/ — WinForms app and generation logic
  - Form1.cs — UI + orchestration for all three stages and helpers (ballistics, HE penetration, pairing rules)
  - TochkaAM.cs — Tochka-SM2 sight generator
  - Luch.cs, Luch_Lite.cs, Duga.cs, Duga2.cs, Sector.cs — other sight generators
- examples/ — reference inputs/outputs to illustrate the pipeline
  - Datamine/ — sample .blkx inputs
  - Data/ — stage 1 outputs (per-vehicle .txt)
  - Ballistic/ — stage 2 outputs (per-vehicle, per-shell .txt)
  - Localization/ — CSVs used for labels in sights
  - UserSights/ — sample final .blk outputs
- assets/ — utility scripts and a full reference Datamine/ tree

## The three-stage pipeline

### 1) Convert Datamine (Button1_Click)

Input:
- War Thunder datamine exports, primarily .blkx files under aces.vromfs.bin_u/gamedata/units/tankmodels and weapon/rocket modules.

Process:
- Parse vehicle .blkx to find weapon and rocket module paths, cockpit FOV (zoom), and laser presence.
- Parse weapon/rocket .blkx to enumerate projectiles and extract physical parameters: mass, caliber, muzzle velocity, drag (Cx), explosive mass/type, DeMarre coefficients, and (for APDS-FS) armor power series.
- Normalize values (e.g., average Cx arrays if a list is present).
- Resolve human-readable names from Localization CSVs (e.g., units_weaponry.csv).

Output:
- Data/<vehicle>.txt — compact text file with a header (paths, zoom, HasLaser) and multiple Name blocks with projectile parameters. See docs/formats.md for schema.

### 2) Make Ballistic (Button3_Click)

Input:
- Data/<vehicle>.txt from stage 1.

Process:
- For each Name block (skipping rockets, smoke, practice, etc.), compute a trajectory and penetration curve by numerical integration using the code’s Ballistic(...) helper. AP/APHE/APDS use DeMarre; APDS-FS may use supplied ArmorPower arrays. HE shells have zero penetration but still produce a trajectory.

Output:
- Ballistic/<vehicle>/<shell>.txt — a tabular file with three columns: distance (m), time (s), penetration (mm). See docs/formats.md for details.

### 3) Make Sights (Button2_Click)

Input:
- Ballistic tables from stage 2, Data/<vehicle>.txt metadata, and Localization/*.csv.

Process:
- For the selected sight family (Tochka-SM2, Luch, Luch Lite, Duga, Duga-2, Sector), read ballistic tables and options from the UI, compute geometry (ticks, labels, preemptive lines), and render a sight script string via the sight’s Create(...) method.
- Variants (e.g., DoubleShells, Laser, Rocket, Howitzer) adjust data sources or drawing logic.

Output:
- UserSights/<vehicle>/.../*.blk — ready-to-use sight scripts.

## Core components

- Form1.cs
  - Button1_Click — Convert Datamine
  - Button3_Click — Make Ballistic
  - Button2_Click — Make Sights
  - Helpers:
    - Ballistic(...) — trajectory + DeMarre penetration integration (handles AP, APHE, APDS, APDS-FS)
    - HePenetration(mass, type) — explosive equivalence to HE penetration
    - CanUseDoubleShell(...) — rules for pairing two shells in a “double” sight

- Sight generators (Create(...))
  - Tochka-SM2 (TochkaAM.cs): rich feature set including Double/Laser/Rocket/Howitzer variants
  - Luch, Luch Lite, Duga, Duga-2, Sector: analogous Create(...) methods for different layouts

## Data flow between folders

- Datamine → Data — per-vehicle consolidated parameters (txt)
- Data → Ballistic — per-shell ballistic tables (txt)
- Ballistic + Localization (+ options) → UserSights — sight .blk scripts

Each stage can be re-run independently if its inputs change.
